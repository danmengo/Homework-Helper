## Challenges we ran into
coming up with an idea took the longest, we started working on various alternative ideas before settling for this one. our limited coding experience and knowledge was detrimental at times, but through collaboration (and w3schools) we were able to produce a functional product.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
